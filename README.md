## This App can connect to the server. I made this app to be able to communicate with C++ BOOST ASIO Server(https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_77_0/doc/html/boost_asio/example/cpp03/chat/chat_server.cpp) and Client(https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_77_0/doc/html/boost_asio/example/cpp03/chat/chat_client.cpp).
